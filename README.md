# kafka-cursors
Cursor theme based on Kafka from Honkai Star Rail

It was made by [乱涂乱画ben](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16588440), and ported to Linux by [PXRYZL](https://www.gnome-look.org/u/pxryzl) (afaik).
I am merely re-uploading it to Github so that it is easier for me to pull it from my NixOS configuration.
